**Potato Disease Classification using CNN**

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classification system designed to classify potato leaves into three categories:

Early Blight
Late Blight
Healthy

**Project Overview**
Potato diseases, such as early blight and late blight, can drastically affect crop yield. By using a CNN, this project aims to classify potato leaf images into diseased and healthy categories. 

**Model Architecture**
The model is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using TensorFlow/Keras. The architecture includes:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
MaxPooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
Dense (Fully connected) layers for classification.
